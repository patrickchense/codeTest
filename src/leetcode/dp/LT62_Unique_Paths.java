A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?


Example 1:

Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
Example 2:

Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28

怎么用一个int, 而不是int[][]来记录是关键


 */
public class LT62_Unique_Paths {

    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int[] dp = new int[m];
        Arrays.fill(dp,1);
        for(int j = 1; j < n;j++){
            for(int i = 0; i < m; i++ ){
                dp[i] = dp[i] + ((i-1>=0)? dp[i-1]: 0);
            }
        }
        return dp[m-1];
    }
}
